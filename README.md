# Tidally Fitness
### Skills
React Native, Expo, Firebase, Native Wind, Clerk, Figma
### Goal
My intention to create this app is to offer a simplistic, workout/note management app, but elevate the traditional static display of text with dynamic "PowerPoint"-slide-style with built-in timers and interactive animations. By having in-app friend system, chatting features, and virtual workout rooms, this app significantly elevates user-engagement compared to tradtional to-do-list-style workout logging.
### Notable Features
- Developed a full-stack, cross-platform fitness app with exercise logging, real-time chat, and synchronized group workout sessions, leveraging Firebase Cloud Firestore for real-time multi-user interactions
- Implemented Google OAuth2 authentication using Firebase SDK for secure, simplified login
- Optimized UI animations with Animatable, utilizing GPU-accelerated, pre-built animations to reduce JavaScript thread usage for smoother transitions over the built-in Animated API; designed an elegant, responsive interface with Native Wind
- Designed a file-based navigation system using Expo Router for simplified routing logic, development efficiency, and code maintainability
